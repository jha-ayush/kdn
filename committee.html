						<h3>STRUCTURE</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12 feature-text animate-box">
						<p>Established in March 2001, as a <b>US 501(c)(3)</b> non-profit organization, KDN has a head office currently based in the State of Maryland, USA. Preparations are underway to establish regional offices in Europe and Ethiopia. Each regional office is established according to the laws of individual countries and can adopt its own bylaws consistent with the current KDN bylaws. Besides, each regional office will have the autonomy to raise and manage funds, finance projects identified by KDN, and remain accountable to its financing sources.</p>
						<p>The major role of the head office is to coordinate programs of regional offices, formulating policy framework, and identifying projects to be financed by each regional office. KDN head office is organized into the Board of Directors, executive committee, and advisory committees. The powers, duties and term of office of elected board members, executive officers (president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer) and advisory committee members are clearly stated in the KDN Bylaws. All elected officers serve the Network without compensation. KDN Board and executive officers conduct the day-to-day activity through personal contact, email, and teleconferencing.</p>
						<p>KDN Advisory Committees consist of members and, in some occasions, non-members having interests, expertise and/or specialization in topics or projects identified by the Board of Directors. The current Advisory Committees include, but are not limited to &mdash; <b><em>Scholarship Committee, Grant Writing and Fund Raising Committee, Curriculum Development &amp; Literacy Campaign Committee, Employment Generation Scheme Committee, Project Planning and Budget Committee, Infrastructure Committee, Health Committee, Science &amp; Technology Committee, Research &amp; Publications Committee, Public Relations, Web-Site Design and Maintenance EXEC COMMITTEE</em></b></p>
